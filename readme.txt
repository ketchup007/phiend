Phiend is a PHP application framework - a solid basis for any internet
application that encourages good programming practices.

Phiend helps you create internet applications based on the MVC design pattern,
also known as Model 2. This is an established, proven concept, greatly
improving configurability and maintainability of code. Phiend provides
a Controller component, and integrates easily with existing technologies
to provide other parts. It can use any data access technology for the backend,
including PEAR DB and ADODB. On the other side, it seamlessly combines with
any presentation system, such as a XSLT, Smarty templates, or raw PHP.

Phiend is inspired by and based on Struts, which is the MVC solution for Java.
Phiend is an attempt to bring these qualities to PHP. However, it is not
a simple port of Struts. Phiend has been written from scratch to fully
utilize PHP, in order to achieve exceptional performance.

Phiend uses an XML configuration file, precompiled into PHP code in order
to reduce the overhead of parsing.

Apart from basic MVC functionality, Phiend comes with built-in error reporting,
logging and user authentication.
